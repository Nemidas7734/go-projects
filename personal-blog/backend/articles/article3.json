From the first moon landing to the recent Mars rover missions, each step forward brings us closer to understanding the universe. The vastness of space reminds us of how small we are and fuels our curiosity to learn more.\n\nUpcoming missions like the James Webb Space Telescope promise to uncover the mysteries of distant galaxies and even search for signs of extraterrestrial life.
